						<p>Keith has been involved in a number of software projects ranging from research at University of Massachusetts, Amherst and Binghamton University, to startups and companies such as Lockheed Martin and Bloomberg. Keith is currently focused on mobile development in the area of education, working to bring about a global shift in the way we view education. Although focusing largely on education, there are a few other areas where Keith would like to make an  impact, including: Ocean Exploration, Renewability and The Transition to Solar Power.<br /><br />
                            
                            Keith's interests are as varied as his ambitions. Growing up with four distinct seasons allowed Keith to develop different interests, including snowboarding, windsurfing, guitar, biking, and airsoft. Keith has also been fortunate to have lived in and learned the culture of cities such as New York and London, as well as to have traveled to remote areas in Norway, Malta and Utah. He always makes sure to return home in between other adventures to see family and friends.
